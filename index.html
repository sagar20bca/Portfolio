                <p>NABARD suggests a model for running of STLs including testing fee of Rs.150/- per soil sample (excluding micro-nutrients) and Rs.150/- per water sample. The benefits in the first three years, and fourth year onwards would be Rs.4.20 lakh, Rs.1.53 lakh, Rs.3.93 lakh and Rs.4.41 lakh respectively. The project cost comprises of Rs.8.60 lakh towards capital cost and Rs.4.104 lakh or operational cost in the first year. The operational cost in the second, third and fourth year onwards is Rs.4.464 lakh, Rs.5.064 lakh and Rs.5.184 lakh respectively. The margin money/down payment considered in the model is 15 per cent of the unit cost which works out to Rs.1,90,000.</p>

                <p>What’s the nutritional difference between the carrot I ate in 1970 and one I eat today? I’ve heard that that there’s very little nutrition left. Is that true?</p>

                <h1>Bess Ruff, MA</h1>
                <p>Soil erosion is a growing problem in today’s world, as evolving climatic conditions like intense rain and wind cause soil to be lost and exhausted at an alarming rate. Topsoil is vital to sustaining plant growth of all kinds, natural and cultivated, and is typically lost through two means: wind erosion and runoff from precipitation or excess watering. Follow these guidelines to safeguard the soil around your home and garden and ensure that it remains hospitable to botanical life.</p>

                <h1>JON HEGGIE</h1>
                <p>We might imagine soil as endless and indestructible: it is neither. Only about 7.5 percent of the earth’s surface provides the soil we rely on for agriculture, and it is remarkably fragile. Topsoil is used to grow 95 percent of our food, and it is disappearing ten times faster than it is being replaced: America’s corn belt has already lost much of its topsoil, threatening livelihoods and communities as well as food supply. The reality is that it takes thousands of years to create an inch of fertile topsoil, but it can be destroyed in minutes.</p>

                <h1>Melissa Breyer</h1>
                <p>Unless you happen to be a farmer or a gardener, chances are you don't think about soil very often. Even among the eco-minded, we generally think more about the water and air and forests and animals before we think about soil.


                    But just like we require healthy water and air, so do we require healthy soil. As the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) explains: "Soil provides ecosystem services critical for life: soil acts as a water filter and a growing medium; provides habitat for billions of organisms, contributing to biodiversity; and supplies most of the antibiotics used to fight diseases. Humans use soil as a holding facility for solid waste, filter for wastewater, and foundation for our cities and towns. Finally, soil is the basis of our nation’s agroecosystems which provide us with feed, fiber, food and fuel."</p>
